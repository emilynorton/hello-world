Learning Git Hub

Hi All!  

I'm Emily. I've been re-teaching myself all of the front-end development that I've missed in the past 8 years while I was in a beige cubicle doing other things. I miss knowing code. I love it. I'm back, baby! This is me learning GitHub! I'm very happy about it. 

Hello World.
